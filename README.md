# C++ Book Club Management Program

## Overview
This C++ program manages data for a book club, handling books and club members. It utilizes multiple classes and objects as outlined in a UML class diagram provided by the instructor. The program is designed to manage books and members dynamically using statically and dynamically allocated arrays.

## Features
- **Book Management**: Add, remove, and display books using a dynamically allocated array.
- **Club Member Management**: Manage club members, including adding, removing, and displaying member details.
- **Book Ratings**: Members can rate books, and the program can display book ratings, best-rated books, and most-rated books.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Utilizes both statically and dynamically allocated arrays for managing books and members.

## Classes and Their Functionality
- **Book Class**: Manages individual book details including ID, title, author, and year of publication.
- **Club Member Class**: Manages individual member details including ID, first name, and last name.
- **Books Array Class**: Manages an array of books, including adding, removing, finding, and printing books.
- **Members Array Class**: Manages an array of club members, including adding, removing, finding, and printing members.
- **Ratings Class**: Combines the book and club member classes to allow rating functionality.

## Implementation
- The program is implemented following the provided UML class diagram and includes classes for books, members, arrays of books and members, and ratings.
- Each class is designed with encapsulation in mind, separating the interface and implementation details.
- The program is designed to be user-interactive and provide a console-based interface for managing the book club data.

## How to Compile and Run
